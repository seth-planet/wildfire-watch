# RTSP Validation Test Summary

## Overview
Successfully created integration tests for RTSP validation that use real cameras on the network without internal mocking.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Real Camera Discovery
- Uses CameraDetector's discovery methods to find cameras
- Focuses on known camera subnet (192.168.5.0/24) for faster discovery
- Skips nmap (requires root) and uses socket scanning instead
- Successfully discovers cameras via port scanning

### 2. Real RTSP Validation
- Tests actual RTSP stream validation with discovered cameras
- Uses real cv2.VideoCapture through ProcessPoolExecutor
- Validates multiple RTSP path patterns per camera
- Confirms that cameras support the expected credentials

### 3. Test Results
- Successfully discovered 8 cameras on the network
- Validated RTSP streams for 7 cameras:
  - BackYardCam (192.168.5.176)
  - SideGate (192.168.5.178)
  - FrontDoorCam (192.168.5.179)
  - DrivewayCamera (192.168.5.180)
  - RearDoorCam (192.168.5.181)
  - GarageDoor (192.168.5.182)
  - One unnamed camera (192.168.5.183)
- One camera (192.168.5.198) had timeout issues

### 4. Security
- Camera credentials are passed via environment variables only
- No hardcoded credentials in test files
- Uses CAMERA_CREDENTIALS environment variable

### 5. Test Configuration
- Increased RTSP_TIMEOUT to 20s for real cameras
- Enabled debug logging for troubleshooting
- Proper executor cleanup in tearDown
- Skips tests when SKIP_HARDWARE_TESTS=true

## Files Modified/Created
- `tests/test_rtsp_validation_integration.py` - New integration test file
- Removed `test_rtsp_validation_improved.py` and `test_rtsp_validation_timeout.py`

## Running the Tests
```bash
# Run with real cameras
python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_rtsp_validation_integration.py -v

# Skip hardware tests
SKIP_HARDWARE_TESTS=true python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_rtsp_validation_integration.py -v

# With custom credentials
CAMERA_CREDENTIALS=username:password python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_rtsp_validation_integration.py -v
```

## Next Steps
- Continue with adding Coral TPU hardware tests
- Add TensorRT GPU tests
- Create comprehensive E2E hardware integration tests
