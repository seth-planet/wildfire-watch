# YOLO-NAS Pipeline End-to-End Testing Plan

## Overview
Run and fix the complete YOLO-NAS pipeline to ensure it produces a working model for Frigate.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Prerequisites Check - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Python 3.10.18 available
- ✅ Dataset found: 283,543 training images and 283,631 labels
- ✅ GPU: NVIDIA RTX A2000 12GB available
- ✅ super-gradients already installed
- ✅ 59.2 GB disk space available

### Phase 2: Pipeline Dry Run - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ YOLO-NAS imports and setup working correctly
- ✅ Model creation successful (YoloNAS_S)
- ✅ Forward pass working (returns tuple outputs as expected)
- ✅ Dataset configuration correctly prepared (32 classes)
- ✅ Training script generation working

### Phase 3: Fix Dependencies and Imports - ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- Resolve super-gradients installation issues
- Fix import path problems
- Update timeout configurations

### Phase 4: Full Pipeline Execution - ⏳ PENDING
- Run complete training pipeline
- Monitor for failures during long execution
- Fix conversion and deployment issues

### Phase 5: Frigate Integration Testing - ⏳ PENDING
- Validate generated TensorRT model
- Test Frigate configuration
- Verify model loads correctly in Frigate

## Testing
- Integration test of complete pipeline
- Model validation tests
- Frigate compatibility verification

## Timeline
- Phase 1-3: 2-4 hours (setup and fixes)
- Phase 4: 48-72 hours (training)
- Phase 5: 1-2 hours (validation)
