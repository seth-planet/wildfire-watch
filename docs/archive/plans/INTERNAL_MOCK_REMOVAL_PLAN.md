## Execution Strategy

### üîÑ Iterative Approach
1. **One Task at a Time**: Execute tasks individually to isolate impact
2. **Test After Each Change**: Run relevant tests after each mock removal
3. **Fix Issues Immediately**: Address any bugs before proceeding
4. **Document Learnings**: Record what was learned from each change

### üß™ Validation Process
1. **Individual Test**: Run specific test method that was changed
2. **Module Test**: Run entire test_detect.py to check for side effects
3. **Core Test**: Run consensus/trigger/telemetry to ensure no regression
4. **Integration Check**: Verify overall system integration still works

### üìù Progress Tracking
- **Status Updates**: Mark each task as IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETE ‚Üí NOTES
- **Issue Log**: Document any bugs found and how they were resolved
- **Learning Capture**: Record insights about real vs mocked behavior

---

## Risk Mitigation

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Measures
1. **Incremental Changes**: Small changes to minimize risk
2. **Immediate Validation**: Test after each change
3. **Rollback Plan**: Keep original mocks documented for rollback if needed
4. **External Mock Preservation**: Maintain appropriate external dependency mocking

### üéØ Success Criteria
1. **All Tests Pass**: Camera detector tests continue to pass
2. **Real Behavior**: Internal methods execute authentic logic
3. **Proper Isolation**: External dependencies remain appropriately mocked
4. **Performance**: Test execution time remains reasonable
