4. Fix failing tests
5. Re-run until all pass

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% test pass rate
- No skipped tests without documentation
- Clear test output

## Phase 9: Handle Test Failures - ⏳ PENDING
**Objective**: Fix any issues discovered during testing

### Tasks:
1. Analyze each test failure
2. Determine if issue is in code or test
3. Fix code issues first, test issues second
4. Add regression tests for fixed issues
5. Update documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- All issues resolved
- Regression tests added
- Documentation updated
