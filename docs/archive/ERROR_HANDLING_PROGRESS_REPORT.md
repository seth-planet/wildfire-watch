  - Path resolution for Docker vs bare metal
  - Centralized MQTT topic management
  - Environment variable overrides

- **Service-Specific Configs**
  - CameraDetectorConfig
  - FireConsensusConfig
  - GPIOTriggerConfig

- **Migration Guide** (`docs/configuration_migration_guide.md`)
  - Step-by-step migration instructions
  - Code examples for each service
  - Testing strategies

## Key Improvements

### 1. Safety Critical Systems
- GPIO operations now fail safely with verification
- Emergency shutdown continues even if some operations fail
- Thread-safe state management prevents race conditions

### 2. Network Reliability
- No more infinite connection loops
- Explicit timeouts on all network operations
- Services continue operating in degraded mode when MQTT unavailable

### 3. Hardware Flexibility
- Supports multiple GPUs and TPUs
- No assumptions about device availability
- Dynamic resolution handling for any camera

### 4. Deployment Flexibility
- Single codebase works in Docker, Kubernetes, Balena, and bare metal
- No hardcoded hostnames or paths
- Environment-specific configuration without code changes

## Remaining Phases

### Phase 5: Thread Safety (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Add locks to Camera Detector shared state
- Protect Telemetry service globals
- Ensure all timer operations are atomic

### Phase 6: Docker vs Bare Metal
- Complete path abstraction
- Handle permission differences
- Device mapping error handling

### Phase 7: Test Fixes
- Remove internal mocking
- Add hardware variation tests
- Ensure compatibility with test runner

### Phase 8: Hardware Test Coverage
- Coral TPU tests
- AMD GPU tests
- TensorRT tests
- Raspberry Pi 5 validation

## Testing Status

Core services continue to pass tests after improvements:
- ✅ GPIO Trigger tests pass with safety wrappers
- ✅ Consensus tests pass (original implementation)
- ✅ Detector tests pass (original implementation)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Begin migrating services to use ConfigManager
   - Deploy resilient MQTT clients in staging
   - Test hardware detector on target devices

2. **Testing Priority**:
   - Validate GPIO safety on Raspberry Pi hardware
   - Test network timeouts with unreliable connections
   - Verify multi-GPU/TPU enumeration

3. **Next Phase**:
   - Focus on Phase 5: Thread Safety
