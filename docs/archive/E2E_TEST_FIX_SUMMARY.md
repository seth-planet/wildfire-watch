# E2E Test Fix Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed the E2E integration tests for the Wildfire Watch system. The main issue was that Docker containers were not respecting the `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX` environment variable because the images were outdated.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MQTT Namespace Mismatch
**Problem**: Services in Docker containers were publishing to non-namespaced topics while tests expected namespaced topics.
**Root Cause**: Docker images were outdated and didn't include the latest code supporting `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX`.
**Solution**: Rebuilt all Docker images with the latest code.

### 2. Camera Detector MQTT Stability
**Problem**: The camera_detector service was experiencing frequent MQTT disconnections.
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive MQTT stability improvements:
- Changed `clean_session` from False to True
- Reduced keepalive from 60s to 30s
- Added thread-safe MQTT publish queue
- Created dedicated MQTT publisher thread
- Added automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff

### 3. Mosquitto Configuration Error
**Problem**: "The retry_interval option is no longer available" error when starting test broker.
**Solution**: Removed the deprecated `retry_interval` option from `enhanced_mqtt_broker.py`.

### 4. Python Version Inconsistency
**Problem**: fire_consensus Dockerfile was using Python 3.13 while other services used 3.12.
**Solution**: Updated all Dockerfiles to use Python 3.12 for consistency.

### 5. E2E Hardware Test False Positives
**Problem**: Tests were failing because they looked for the word "error" in logs, but Frigate has many informational messages containing "error".
**Solution**: Updated error detection to look for specific critical errors instead of just the word "error".

## Files Modified

1. **camera_detector/detect.py**
   - Added thread-safe MQTT publish queue
   - Implemented dedicated publisher thread
   - Fixed MQTT connection stability issues

2. **tests/enhanced_mqtt_broker.py**
   - Removed deprecated retry_interval option

3. **fire_consensus/Dockerfile**
   - Changed Python version from 3.13 to 3.12

4. **tests/test_integration_e2e_improved.py**
   - Fixed namespace handling to avoid double-prefixing
   - Used raw MQTT client for subscriptions

5. **tests/test_e2e_hardware_docker.py**
   - Fixed error checking to look for specific critical errors
   - Updated Frigate health check logic

## Docker Images Rebuilt
- `wildfire-watch/camera_detector:latest`
- `wildfire-watch/fire_consensus:latest`
- `wildfire-watch/gpio_trigger:latest`

## Test Results
- ✅ E2E health monitoring test: PASSED
- ✅ E2E service startup order test: PASSED
- ✅ E2E camera discovery test: PASSED
- ✅ E2E multi-camera consensus test: PASSED
- ✅ E2E pump safety timeout test: PASSED
- ✅ E2E multi-accelerator failover test: PASSED

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring test stability
2. Consider adding automatic Docker image rebuilding to test setup
3. Document the MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX requirement for Docker deployments
