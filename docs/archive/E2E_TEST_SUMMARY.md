# E2E Test Summary

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Successful Components

1. **Camera Discovery**
   - Successfully discovered 7 cameras on the 192.168.5.x subnet
   - Cameras are Amcrest models (IP8M-VB2796E and IP8M-2496E-V2)
   - RTSP URLs validated and working
   - Camera detector properly publishes to `camera/discovery/{mac_address}`

2. **Frigate Configuration**
   - Camera detector successfully generates Frigate config
   - Config includes all 7 discovered cameras with proper RTSP URLs
   - Fire and smoke detection configured for each camera

3. **Service Deployment**
   - All services start successfully with host networking
   - MQTT broker running and accessible
   - Consensus service subscribes to correct topics
   - GPIO trigger service ready to activate pumps

### ‚ùå Issues Found

1. **Frigate Config Validation**
   - Generated config has some validation errors with Frigate's strict schema
   - Fixed by creating simplified config for testing

2. **Fire Event Processing**
   - Consensus service receives Frigate events but may not be triggering
   - Need to verify the exact event format expected

### üîß Next Steps

1. Debug why consensus isn't triggering on fire events
2. Verify the complete message flow from Frigate ‚Üí Consensus ‚Üí GPIO
3. Update tests in `tests/test_integration_e2e.py` to use correct topics

## Test Infrastructure

All core functionality is in the services, not test files:
- `camera_detector/detect.py` - Camera discovery and Frigate config generation
- `fire_consensus/consensus.py` - Multi-camera fire detection consensus
- `gpio_trigger/trigger.py` - Pump control state machine

The test files only verify this functionality works correctly.
