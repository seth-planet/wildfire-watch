# E2E Health Reporting Debug Summary

## Issue
The `test_pump_safety_timeout` E2E test is failing because the consensus service health messages are not being received.

## Debugging Steps Taken

### 1. Increased Timeout
- Changed from 15s to 25s to account for 10s health interval
- Still no health messages received

### 2. Added Health Field
- Added `healthy: True` to consensus health reporter output
- Rebuilt Docker image

### 3. Fixed Initialization Order
- Changed to initialize ThreadSafeService before MQTTService
- This ensures timer_manager is available when needed

### 4. Added Debug Logging
- Added logging to health reporter start and publish methods
- Added initial health publish in consensus constructor

### 5. Updated Test to Accept Multiple Health Fields
- Test now accepts either `healthy` or `mqtt_connected` as ready indicators
- Handles both old and new field names for camera counts

## Current Status

The consensus service:
1. Starts successfully (container running)
2. Connects to MQTT broker (logs show "MQTT connected, ready for fire detection messages")
3. Subscribes to topics correctly
4. But does NOT publish health messages

## Key Observations

1. No "Fire Consensus initialized" log message appears
2. No health reporting start messages appear
3. The service appears to stop initializing after MQTT connection
4. The initial health publish added to constructor is not executing

## Hypothesis

The constructor may be failing after MQTT setup but before reaching the initialization complete log. Possible causes:
1. Exception in `_start_background_tasks()`
2. Exception in health reporter initialization
3. Issue with timer manager setup

## Next Steps

1. Add try/catch around entire constructor with detailed logging
2. Test health reporter in isolation
3. Check if timer_manager is properly initialized
4. Simplify health reporting to eliminate potential failure points
