# E2E Test Improvements Summary

## Overview
Based on Gemini's comprehensive analysis, we've implemented significant improvements to the Wildfire Watch E2E test suite to ensure robust testing without skipping any critical functionality.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Pytest E2E Marker Warning
**Issue**: `PytestUnknownMarkWarning: Unknown pytest.mark.e2e`
**Fix**: Added `e2e` marker to pytest.ini configuration file

### 2. ✅ TLS/Security Testing Gap
**Issue**: Tests only ran in insecure mode (port 1883), never testing TLS configuration
**Fix**: 
- Parameterized tests to run in both "insecure" and "tls" modes
- Tests now verify both port 1883 (insecure) and 8883 (TLS)
- Added certificate mounting and TLS configuration for all services

### 3. ✅ Multi-Camera Consensus Bypassed
**Issue**: Consensus threshold set to 1, effectively disabling multi-camera validation
**Fix**:
- Set realistic consensus threshold (minimum 2 cameras)
- Added dedicated test `test_multi_camera_consensus` to verify:
  - Single camera detection does NOT trigger pump
  - Multiple camera detections DO trigger pump
- Consensus threshold now adapts to number of discovered cameras

### 4. ✅ Pump Safety Timeout Not Verified
**Issue**: Test set MAX_ENGINE_RUNTIME but never verified automatic shutoff
**Fix**:
- Added `test_pump_safety_timeout` that:
  - Activates pump via fire detection
  - Waits for safety timeout period
  - Verifies pump automatically deactivates
- Uses Event-based synchronization for reliable testing

### 5. ✅ TensorRT Configuration Error
**Issue**: Frigate configured to use CPU detector despite TensorRT image
**Fix**:
- Updated Frigate config to use TensorRT detector
- Added proper model configuration for INT8 TensorRT
- Specified GPU device and model paths
- Each camera now explicitly uses TensorRT detector

### 6. ✅ Event-Based Synchronization
**Issue**: Tests relied on fixed `time.sleep()` causing flakiness
**Fix**:
- Replaced all critical waits with threading.Event objects
- Tests now wait for specific state changes
- More reliable and faster test execution

### 7. ✅ MQTT Broker Recovery Test
**Issue**: No testing of service resilience to MQTT broker failure
**Fix**:
- Added `test_mqtt_broker_recovery` that:
  - Restarts MQTT broker mid-test
  - Verifies all services reconnect
  - Confirms health messages resume

## New Test Structure

### TestE2EIntegrationImproved
Basic integration tests with improved synchronization:
- `test_service_startup_order` - Verifies correct service dependencies
- `test_camera_discovery_to_frigate` - Event-based discovery validation
- `test_multi_camera_consensus` - Proper consensus threshold testing
- `test_pump_safety_timeout` - Verifies automatic pump shutoff
- `test_health_monitoring` - Event-based health check validation
- `test_mqtt_broker_recovery` - Service resilience testing

### TestE2EPipelineWithRealCamerasImproved
Comprehensive pipeline test with real cameras:
- Parameterized for both insecure and TLS modes
- Proper TensorRT configuration
- Realistic consensus thresholds
- Safety timeout verification
- Complete end-to-end flow validation

## Key Improvements

1. **Security Testing**: All tests now run in both insecure and secure modes
2. **Consensus Validation**: Multi-camera requirement properly tested
3. **Safety Features**: Pump timeout actually verified
4. **AI Acceleration**: TensorRT properly configured and used
5. **Reliability**: Event-based synchronization throughout
6. **Resilience**: MQTT broker failure recovery tested

## Configuration Examples

### TensorRT Detector Configuration
```yaml
detectors:
  tensorrt:
    type: tensorrt
    device: 0

model:
  path: /models/wildfire_640_tensorrt_int8.trt
  input_tensor: images
  input_pixel_format: rgb
  width: 640
  height: 640
```

### Camera Configuration with TensorRT
```yaml
cameras:
  camera_0:
    detect:
      width: 640
      height: 640
      fps: 5
      detector: tensorrt  # Explicitly use TensorRT
```

## Running the Improved Tests

```bash
# Run all improved E2E tests
CAMERA_CREDENTIALS=username:password python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_integration_e2e_improved.py -v

# Run specific test with both TLS modes
CAMERA_CREDENTIALS=username:password python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_integration_e2e_improved.py::TestE2EPipelineWithRealCamerasImproved -v

# Run only insecure mode (faster for development)
CAMERA_CREDENTIALS=username:password python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_integration_e2e_improved.py::TestE2EPipelineWithRealCamerasImproved -v -k "insecure"
```

## Validation Checklist

✅ Security/TLS configuration tested
✅ Multi-camera consensus properly validated
✅ Pump safety timeout verified
✅ TensorRT acceleration configured
✅ Event-based synchronization implemented
✅ Service resilience tested
✅ No functionality skipped
✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Next Steps

1. Consolidate multiple E2E test files into the improved version
2. Add performance benchmarking for TensorRT vs CPU
3. Add test for camera IP address changes (MAC tracking)
4. Add test for partial camera failures during operation
