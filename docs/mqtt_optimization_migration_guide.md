# MQTT Test Optimization Migration Guide

## Overview
This guide helps migrate existing tests to use the optimized MQTT test infrastructure, which provides:
- 10x+ faster test execution
- Parallel test support (pytest-xdist)
- Better test isolation
- Simplified test code

## Key Changes

### 1. Broker Lifecycle
**Before**: Each test class created its own broker
```python
class TestFireConsensus:
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.broker = MQTTTestBroker()
        cls.broker.start()  # 2-3 seconds startup
```

**After**: Use session-scoped broker fixture
```python
def test_fire_consensus(test_mqtt_broker):
    # Broker is already running and available
    broker = test_mqtt_broker
```

### 2. Topic Isolation
**Before**: Hardcoded topics that could collide
```python
def test_detection():
    topic = "fire/detection"  # Shared across all tests!
    client.publish(topic, data)
```

**After**: Use isolated topics
```python
def test_detection(mqtt_topic_factory):
    topic = mqtt_topic_factory("fire/detection")  # Unique: test/abc123/fire/detection
    client.publish(topic, data)
```

### 3. Client Management
**Before**: Manual client lifecycle
```python
def test_something():
    client = mqtt.Client()
    client.connect("localhost", 1883)
    try:
        # test code
    finally:
        client.disconnect()
```

**After**: Automatic client management
```python
def test_something(mqtt_client):
    # Client is already connected
    mqtt_client.publish(topic, data)
    # Automatically disconnected after test
```

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Remove Class-Level Broker Setup
Replace class-level broker initialization with fixture usage:

```python
# OLD
class TestConsensus:
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.broker = MQTTTestBroker()
        cls.broker.start()
        
    def test_something(self):
        client.connect("localhost", self.broker.port)

# NEW
class TestConsensus:
    def test_something(self, test_mqtt_broker, mqtt_client):
        # Both broker and client are ready to use
```

### Step 2: Update Topic References
Replace hardcoded topics with isolated ones:

```python
# OLD
TOPIC_FIRE = "fire/detection"
TOPIC_TRIGGER = "trigger/activate"

def test_fire_flow(self):
    self.client.publish(TOPIC_FIRE, data)
    self.client.subscribe(TOPIC_TRIGGER)

# NEW
def test_fire_flow(self, mqtt_client, mqtt_topic_factory):
    topic_fire = mqtt_topic_factory("fire/detection")
    topic_trigger = mqtt_topic_factory("trigger/activate")
    
    mqtt_client.publish(topic_fire, data)
    mqtt_client.subscribe(topic_trigger)
```

### Step 3: Update Client Usage
Replace manual client management:

```python
# OLD
def test_publish_subscribe(self):
    client1 = mqtt.Client()
    client2 = mqtt.Client()
    
    client1.connect("localhost", self.broker.port)
    client2.connect("localhost", self.broker.port)
    
    # ... test code ...
    
    client1.disconnect()
    client2.disconnect()

# NEW
def test_publish_subscribe(self, mqtt_client, session_mqtt_broker):
    # First client from fixture
    client1 = mqtt_client
    
    # Create additional client if needed
    client2 = mqtt.Client(mqtt.CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2)
    client2.connect(session_mqtt_broker.host, session_mqtt_broker.port)
    client2.loop_start()
    
    try:
        # ... test code ...
    finally:
        client2.loop_stop()
        client2.disconnect()
```

### Step 4: Update Fixture Dependencies
Update test fixtures that depend on MQTT:

```python
# OLD
@pytest.fixture
def consensus_service(class_mqtt_broker):
    service = FireConsensus()
    service.connect(class_mqtt_broker.host, class_mqtt_broker.port)
    yield service
    service.cleanup()

# NEW
@pytest.fixture
def consensus_service(test_mqtt_broker, mqtt_topic_factory):
    # Use unique topics for this service instance
    service = FireConsensus(
        detection_topic=mqtt_topic_factory("fire/detection"),
        trigger_topic=mqtt_topic_factory("trigger/fire")
    )
    service.connect(test_mqtt_broker.host, test_mqtt_broker.port)
    yield service
    service.cleanup()
```

## Real Example: Migrating test_consensus.py

### Before:
```python
class TestConsensusLogic:
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.broker = MQTTTestBroker()
        cls.broker.start()
        
    def test_multi_camera_consensus(self):
        client = mqtt.Client()
        client.connect("localhost", self.broker.port)
        
        # Publish to shared topic
        for i in range(3):
            client.publish("fire/detection", json.dumps({
                "camera_id": f"cam_{i}",
                "confidence": 0.9
            }))
```

### After:
```python
class TestConsensusLogic:
    def test_multi_camera_consensus(self, mqtt_client, mqtt_topic_factory):
        # Use isolated topic
        detection_topic = mqtt_topic_factory("fire/detection")
        
        # Client is already connected
        for i in range(3):
            mqtt_client.publish(detection_topic, json.dumps({
                "camera_id": f"cam_{i}",
                "confidence": 0.9
            }))
```

## Running Tests in Parallel

With these optimizations, you can now run tests in parallel:

```bash
# Install pytest-xdist
pip install pytest-xdist

# Run tests in parallel across all CPU cores
pytest -n auto tests/

# Run tests in parallel with specific worker count
pytest -n 4 tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "MQTT broker failed to start"
- Ensure mosquitto is installed: `sudo apt-get install mosquitto`
- Check if port is already in use
- Verify mosquitto is in PATH

### Issue: Tests interfere with each other
- Ensure all topics use `mqtt_topic_factory`
- Check for hardcoded topic strings
- Verify client IDs are unique

### Issue: Connection timeouts
- The session broker starts once and stays running
- If broker crashes, all tests will fail
- Check broker logs in test output

## Performance Gains

Typical improvements after migration:
- Test suite runtime: 30+ minutes → 3-5 minutes
- Individual test: 2-3s → 0.1-0.5s
- Parallel execution: Not possible → 4-8x speedup

## Best Practices

1. **Always use topic isolation** - Never hardcode topic strings
2. **Prefer fixture clients** - Use `mqtt_client` fixture when possible
3. **Keep tests independent** - Each test should work in isolation
4. **Use QoS appropriately** - QoS 0 for most tests, higher only when testing QoS
5. **Clean up resources** - Additional clients should be properly disconnected

## Summary

The optimized MQTT test infrastructure provides:
- ✅ Single broker startup per session
- ✅ Automatic topic isolation
- ✅ Managed client connections
- ✅ Parallel test execution support
- ✅ 10x+ performance improvement
