# TLS Integration Test Results

## Summary
Successfully implemented and tested TLS support for the Wildfire Watch system with MQTT broker running with TLS enabled.

## Test Execution Results

### 1. TLS Integration Tests (test_tls_integration.py)
**Result: 17/17 PASSED ✅**

Key tests passing:
- Certificate validation
- TLS port listening on 8883
- Secure MQTT connections with certificates
- Publish/subscribe over TLS
- Service TLS configuration
- Docker Compose TLS setup

### 2. Docker TLS Integration Tests (test_docker_tls_integration.py)
**Result: 8/8 PASSED ✅**

Key tests passing:
- MQTT broker exposes TLS port 8883
- Certificates mounted in containers
- TLS connectivity from services
- Inter-service TLS communication

### 3. Services TLS Integration Tests (test_services_tls_integration.py)
**Result: 14/14 PASSED ✅**

Key tests passing:
- All services read MQTT_TLS environment variable
- Certificate handling and validation
- TLS error recovery
- Docker compose TLS configuration

## Total Results: 39/39 Tests PASSED ✅

## Key Achievements

1. **MQTT Broker with TLS**:
   - Running on ports 1883 (plain) and 8883 (TLS)
   - Using certificates from /mnt/data/certs/
   - Configured via mosquitto_tls.conf when MQTT_TLS=true

2. **Service TLS Support**:
   - Camera Detector: Configures TLS when MQTT_TLS=true
   - Fire Consensus: Reads TLS configuration from environment
   - GPIO Trigger: Supports TLS via environment variables
   - All services mount certificate volumes

3. **Certificate Management**:
   - Certificates stored in certs/ directory
   - Mounted as read-only in all containers
   - Hostname verification disabled for test certificates

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - MQTT_TLS=true enables TLS across all services
   - MQTT_TLS_PORT=8883 configures TLS port
   - Certificates auto-detected at /mnt/data/certs/

## Docker Status

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                              STATUS
mqtt_broker    wildfire-watch/mqtt_broker        Up (healthy)
```

MQTT broker is running with:
- Plain MQTT on port 1883
- Secure MQTT (TLS) on port 8883
- WebSocket on port 9001

## Production Deployment

To deploy with TLS in production:

1. Generate production certificates:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_certs.sh custom
   ```

2. Enable TLS in .env:
   ```bash
   MQTT_TLS=true
   MQTT_TLS_PORT=8883
   ```

3. Deploy services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Conclusion

All TLS integration tests are passing without any skips. The Wildfire Watch system now has comprehensive TLS support enabled and tested across all services.
