# Test Fix Summary - YOLO-NAS QAT Hailo E2E Test

## Problem
The test `test_yolo_nas_qat_hailo_e2e.py` was failing with:
```
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'shape'
```

## Root Cause
The error was in `converted_models/class_index_fixer.py`, specifically in the `SafeDataLoaderWrapper._validate_batch()` method. The code assumed that `targets` would always be a PyTorch tensor, but newer versions of YOLO-NAS can return targets as a dictionary.

## Solution
Updated `class_index_fixer.py` to handle both tensor and dictionary targets.

## Files Modified
- `/home/seth/wildfire-watch/converted_models/class_index_fixer.py`

## Verification
1. Created unit test to verify dict handling works correctly
2. Ran actual YOLO-NAS test - it now progresses past the error into the training phase

## Summary
- **YOLO-NAS QAT Hailo E2E test**: ✅ Fixed - no longer fails with dict.shape error
- **Web Interface Tests**: ✅ Were already passing (no fix needed)

The fix ensures compatibility with both older YOLO-NAS versions (tensor targets) and newer versions (dict targets).
