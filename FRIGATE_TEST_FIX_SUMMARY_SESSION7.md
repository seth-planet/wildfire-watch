# Frigate Test Fix Summary - Session 7

## Problem
Frigate tests were failing with "RuntimeError: Frigate failed to become ready after 5.0 seconds. Last error: None"

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Models Directory Mount
- Tests referenced model files but container didn't have access
- Models at `/home/seth/wildfire-watch/converted_models/` weren't mounted

### 2. Timer Logic Bug
- `start_time` was set before initial 5-second sleep
- When tests failed quickly, reported "5.0 seconds" instead of actual wait time
- Made debugging confusing as it looked like instant failure

### 3. Incomplete Retry Configuration
- Retry container creation was missing media_dir and db_dir mounts
- Could cause failures on retry attempts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Models Directory Mount (line 213)
```python
'volumes': {
    config_path: {'bind': '/config/config.yml', 'mode': 'ro'},
    media_dir: {'bind': '/media/frigate', 'mode': 'rw'},
    db_dir: {'bind': '/config', 'mode': 'rw'},  # For frigate.db
    '/dev/shm': {'bind': '/dev/shm', 'mode': 'rw'},  # Required for shared memory
    '/home/seth/wildfire-watch/converted_models': {'bind': '/models', 'mode': 'ro'}  # Mount models directory
},
```

### 2. Fixed Timer Logic (line 249)
```python
# Give Frigate time to start up
time.sleep(5)

# Start timing after initial sleep to get accurate elapsed time
start_time = time.time()
```

### 3. Fixed Retry Configuration (lines 403-407)
Added missing mounts to retry container creation:
```python
'volumes': {
    config_path: {'bind': '/config/config.yml', 'mode': 'ro'},
    media_dir: {'bind': '/media/frigate', 'mode': 'rw'},
    db_dir: {'bind': '/config', 'mode': 'rw'},  # For frigate.db
    '/dev/shm': {'bind': '/dev/shm', 'mode': 'rw'},
    '/home/seth/wildfire-watch/converted_models': {'bind': '/models', 'mode': 'ro'}  # Mount models directory
},
```

## Results
✅ `test_frigate_service_running` - PASSED in 21.25s
✅ `test_frigate_stats_endpoint` - PASSED in 19.52s

## Key Improvements
1. **Model Access**: Container can now access model files if needed
2. **Accurate Timing**: Error messages show actual wait time, not including initial sleep
3. **Robust Retry**: Retry attempts have same configuration as initial attempts
4. **Faster Startup**: Tests now pass quickly (0.0s after initial sleep)
