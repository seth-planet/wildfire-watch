# ðŸ”¥ Wildfire Watch

**Wildfire Watch** is a personal, open-source, edge-deployed wildfire detection and response platform leveraging Frigate NVR, Hailo AI acceleration, MQTT messaging, and GPIO-based pump control.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time wildfire and smoke detection from RTSP camera streams
- Automatic consensus-based triggering of fire suppression pumps
- Edge-ready deployment via Balena and Docker Compose
- Future-ready for extended object detection (people, cars, license plates)

---

## ðŸ“‹ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Hailo TPU (AI accelerator)
- Compatible RTSP security cameras
- MQTT broker (included)
- GPIO-controlled relay (pump and valve control)

### Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seth-planet/wildfire-watch.git
cd wildfire-watch
docker-compose up --build
````

### Balena Deployment

* Create a new Balena app and set device-specific environment variables as needed.
* Push the project to your Balena fleet:

```bash
balena push wildfire-watch
```

---

## ðŸ“¡ MQTT Topics

* `fire/detection`: Wildfire detections from cameras
* `fire/cam_info`: Camera heartbeat and metadata
* `fire/confirmed`: Consensus alerts triggering fire pump
