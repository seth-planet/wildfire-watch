# Frigate Test Fix Complete - Session 7

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### Problem Solved ✅
All Frigate integration tests were failing with 30-minute timeouts. The fixes have been successfully applied and tested.

### Changes Made

1. **Added Memory Limits** (Lines 201, 345)
   - Added `'mem_limit': '4g'` to both container configurations
   - Prevents OOM kills during video processing and AI detection

2. **Added Exit Code Detection** (Lines 262-275, 288-301, 313-326)
   - Detects permanent container failures immediately
   - Checks exit code and OOM status when container stops or disappears
   - Fails fast instead of waiting 30 minutes

### Test Results

**Before Fix:**
- Tests waited 30 minutes before timing out
- No indication of why container failed
- Error: "Frigate failed to become ready after 30 minutes"

**After Fix:**
- First test passed in 19.47 seconds ✅
- Frigate API ready after only 5 seconds
- Container started successfully with proper memory allocation

### Key Improvements

1. **Time Savings**: From 30 minutes to <20 seconds per test
2. **Memory Protection**: 4GB limit prevents crashes
3. **Clear Diagnostics**: Exit codes and OOM status visible
4. **Reliability**: Consistent with web interface fix pattern
