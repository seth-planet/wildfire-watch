# Test Fix Analysis - Refactoring Compatibility

## Current Status
The refactored code has been successfully implemented but tests are failing due to:
1. Changed method names and patterns
2. Removed functionality that was integrated elsewhere
3. Different initialization patterns

## Key Changes in Refactored Code

### Camera Detector
- **Removed**: `camera.id` property â†’ Use `camera.mac` directly
- **Removed**: `camera.ip_history` â†’ Not tracked in refactored version
- **Removed**: `camera.update_ip()` method â†’ Direct assignment
- **Removed**: `camera.to_frigate_config()` method â†’ Config generation elsewhere
- **Removed**: `MACTracker` class â†’ Integrated into CameraDetector
- **Changed**: `_update_frigate_config()` â†’ Different pattern
- **Changed**: `_publish_camera_discovery()` â†’ `_publish_camera()`
- **Changed**: `_publish_health()` â†’ Handled by HealthReporter

### Fire Consensus
- **Changed**: Config attributes from UPPERCASE to lowercase
- **Changed**: Different initialization pattern with base classes

### Common Patterns
- All services now inherit from `MQTTService` and `ThreadSafeService`
- Health reporting handled by `HealthReporter` base class
- Configuration uses `ConfigBase` with schema validation

## Test Fix Strategy

### Option 1: Update Tests to Match Refactored Code
**Pros**: Tests validate actual production code
**Cons**: Significant test rewriting required

### Option 2: Add Compatibility Layer
**Pros**: Tests pass quickly
**Cons**: Not testing actual code patterns (rejected by user)

### Recommended Approach
Update tests incrementally:
1. Fix critical unit tests first
2. Update integration tests to use new patterns
3. Focus on E2E tests that validate actual functionality

## Progress
- âœ… Fixed config access patterns in MQTTService
- âœ… Started fixing camera model tests
- ðŸ”„ Many more test updates needed
