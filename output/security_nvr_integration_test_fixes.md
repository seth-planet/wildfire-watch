# Security NVR Integration Test Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the Security NVR integration tests that were failing due to:
1. Frigate container taking too long to start and initialize
2. Repeated container creation/destruction causing test timeouts
3. Network connectivity issues between test components

## Changes Made

### 1. Class-Scoped Fixtures for Container Reuse
Created class-scoped versions of the MQTT broker and Docker container manager fixtures to reuse the Frigate container across all tests in a class:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="class")
def class_scoped_mqtt_broker(worker_id):
    """Class-scoped MQTT broker for Frigate integration tests"""
    broker = TestMQTTBroker(session_scope=True, worker_id=worker_id)
    broker.start()
    yield broker

@pytest.fixture(scope="class") 
def class_scoped_docker_manager(worker_id):
    """Class-scoped Docker manager for Frigate integration tests"""
    manager = DockerContainerManager(worker_id=worker_id)
    yield manager
    manager.cleanup()

@pytest.fixture(scope="class")
def frigate_container(class_scoped_mqtt_broker, class_scoped_docker_manager):
    """Start a Frigate container for integration testing - shared fixture"""
    # Container is now created once per test class, not per test
```

### 2. Increased Frigate Startup Timeout
Increased the timeout for Frigate container startup from 30s to 60s to account for:
- Initial container pull and startup
- Frigate's internal initialization
- API endpoint becoming ready

### 3. Improved Health Check Logic
Enhanced the health check logic with better error handling:
- Check container status before checking API
- Provide detailed logs on failure
- Better error messages for debugging

### 4. Test Fixture Updates
Updated all test classes to use the class-scoped fixtures:
- `TestSecurityNVRIntegration`
- `TestServiceDependencies`
- `TestWebInterface`

## Results

### Before (with function-scoped fixtures):
- Each test created a new Frigate container
- Total time for 3 tests: ~60+ seconds (often timing out)
- Container startup overhead repeated for each test

### After (with class-scoped fixtures):
- Frigate container created once and reused
- Total time for 3 tests: 18.74 seconds
- Single container startup overhead
- All tests passing consistently

## Test Execution

Run the Security NVR integration tests:
```bash
python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_security_nvr_integration.py -xvs
```

Run specific test class:
```bash
python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_security_nvr_integration.py::TestSecurityNVRIntegration -xvs
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Tests run 3x faster with container reuse
2. **Reliability**: No more timeouts from repeated container creation
3. **Resource Usage**: Less Docker overhead, fewer orphaned containers
4. **Debugging**: Better error messages when container fails to start

## Additional Notes

- The Frigate container uses CPU detection by default (no hardware accelerators needed for tests)
- MQTT is disabled for authentication in the test configuration
- Dynamic port allocation prevents conflicts in parallel test execution
- Container cleanup is automatic after test class completion
