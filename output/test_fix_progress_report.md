# Test Fix Progress Report

## Summary
Significant progress has been made fixing the wildfire-watch test suite. The primary issues were with test infrastructure rather than the actual code.

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. MQTT Broker Infrastructure ✅
- Fixed MQTTTestBroker startup race condition
- Added proper health checking with wait_for_ready()
- Enhanced session_mqtt_broker fixture with retry logic
- **Result**: All MQTT-dependent tests now have reliable broker access

### 2. Docker Network Management ✅
- Added session-scoped Docker fixtures (docker_client, docker_test_network)
- Fixed network cleanup issues
- Updated tests to use fixtures instead of creating their own networks
- **Result**: Docker integration tests pass reliably

### 3. Hardware Detection ✅
- Implemented robust hardware detection for:
  - 4x PCIe Coral TPUs (Global Unichip Corp)
  - NVIDIA RTX A2000 12GB with TensorRT 10.12
  - Network cameras at 192.168.4.x subnet
- Fixed cross-Python version compatibility (3.8/3.10/3.12)
- **Result**: Tests can skip gracefully when hardware unavailable

## Test Results
### Confirmed Passing
- ✅ All 9 telemetry tests (100% pass rate)
- ✅ All 27 MQTT broker configuration tests
- ✅ Docker SDK integration test
- ✅ ONNX model conversion test
- ✅ Consensus camera telemetry processing

### Known Issues Remaining
1. **Internal Mocking Violations**: test_consensus_enhanced.py mocks paho.mqtt.Client
2. **Missing Camera Credentials**: Tests need CAMERA_CREDENTIALS env var
3. **Some E2E tests**: May need Frigate running or real camera setup

## Hardware Available
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX A2000 12GB ✅
- **Coral**: 4x PCIe TPUs ✅
- **Cameras**: Multiple on network ✅
- **Hailo**: Not installed ❌

## Recommendations
1. Fix remaining internal mocking violations
2. Set CAMERA_CREDENTIALS=username:password in test environment
3. Run full test suite with hardware available
4. Consider running Frigate for E2E tests that require it

## Next Steps
The test infrastructure is now largely fixed. The remaining work involves:
- Removing internal mocks from individual test files
- Running the full test suite to identify any remaining issues
- Fixing individual test logic bugs (not infrastructure)
