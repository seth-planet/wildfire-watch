# Wildfire Watch Test Review - Progress Update

## Date: 2025-06-26

### Major Accomplishments üéâ

1. **Fixed Critical MQTT Port Bug**
   - Found and fixed hardcoded port (1883) in camera_detector/detect.py line 838
   - Bug prevented tests from connecting to test broker
   - Used Gemini debug tool to systematically investigate the issue
   - Fix: Changed `port = 8883 if self.config.MQTT_TLS else 1883` to use `self.config.MQTT_PORT`

2. **Camera Detector Tests Working**
   - Created test_camera_detector_real_mqtt.py with real MQTT broker
   - 8 out of 12 tests passing:
     - ‚úÖ Config tests (2/2)
     - ‚úÖ Camera model tests (3/3)
     - ‚úÖ MAC tracker tests (2/2)
     - ‚úÖ MQTT camera publication test
     - ‚ùå ONVIF discovery test (needs investigation)
     - ‚ùå Frigate config publication test (needs investigation)
     - ‚è±Ô∏è TLS test (timed out)

3. **Consensus Tests Fully Working**
   - All 6 consensus integration tests passing
   - Fixed cooldown test by sending 8 detections (minimum required)
   - Proper test isolation with topic prefixes
   - Clean fixture design with monkeypatch

4. **Test Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Topic prefix support in all services
   - Session-scoped MQTT broker with proper health checks
   - Hardware detection across Python versions
   - Docker network infrastructure fixed

### Technical Discoveries

1. **Module Reload Issue**
   - Config class instantiates at import time
   - Environment variables must be set before import
   - Solution: Delete modules from sys.modules and reimport

2. **MQTT Message Structure**
   - Camera discovery payload has nested structure:
     ```json
     {
       "event": "discovered",
       "camera": { /* camera data */ },
       "node_id": "...",
       "timestamp": "..."
     }
     ```

3. **Test Fixture Hierarchy**
   - session_mqtt_broker ‚Üí test_mqtt_broker ‚Üí mqtt_client
   - All use the same broker instance for consistency

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Fixed Bugs in Original Code**
   - MQTT port hardcoding in camera detector
   - Topic prefix support added to all services
   - Proper cleanup and resource management

2. **Test Design Patterns**
   - Real MQTT broker for integration testing
   - External dependency mocking only (WSDiscovery, ONVIFCamera)
   - Proper fixture isolation with monkeypatch

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining Camera Detector Tests**
   - Investigate ONVIF discovery test failure
   - Fix Frigate config publication test
   - Address TLS test timeout

2. **Continue Test Migration**
   - Remove internal mocking from test_detect.py
   - Apply MQTT optimization patterns to remaining tests
   - Fix test_consensus.py unit tests

3. **Final Verification**
   - Run scripts/run_tests_by_python_version.sh --all
   - Ensure all Python version routing works
   - Document final test organization

### Lessons Learned

1. **Debug Systematically**
   - Use AI tools like Gemini for complex debugging
   - Check logs carefully for connection details
   - Verify both ends of communication

2. **Test Real Behavior**
   - Integration tests catch real bugs
   - Mocking internal modules hides issues
   - Use real infrastructure where possible

3. **Configuration Matters**
   - Environment variables need careful handling
   - Hardcoded values break flexibility
   - Always use configuration objects

This comprehensive test review has already uncovered and fixed a critical bug that would have prevented the camera detector from working in test environments.
