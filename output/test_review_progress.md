# Wildfire Watch Test Review Progress Report

## Date: 2025-06-26

### Summary
Comprehensive test review and fixes in progress following CLAUDE.md integration testing philosophy.

### Completed Tasks âœ…

1. **MQTT Broker Infrastructure**
   - Fixed hardcoded 2-second wait in broker startup
   - Added proper health checking with `wait_for_ready()`
   - Session-scoped broker fixture with retry logic
   - All 27 MQTT broker tests passing

2. **Docker Infrastructure**
   - Cleaned up leftover containers from previous test runs
   - Added session-scoped `docker_test_network` fixture
   - Modified tests to use fixtures instead of creating own networks
   - Docker SDK integration test passing

3. **Hardware Detection**
   - Fixed hardware detection to properly identify available hardware:
     - 4x PCIe Coral TPUs detected via lspci
     - NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU with TensorRT support
     - Cameras on 192.168.4.x network
   - Hardware detection functions now work across Python versions

4. **Topic Prefix Support**
   - Added MQTT topic prefix support to all services:
     - âœ… fire_consensus/consensus.py - Uses MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX env var
     - âœ… gpio_trigger/trigger.py - Uses MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX env var
     - âœ… camera_detector/detect.py - Uses MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX env var
     - âœ… cam_telemetry/telemetry.py - Uses MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX env var
   - This enables proper test isolation for parallel test execution

5. **Test Categories Working**
   - âœ… All 9 telemetry tests passing
   - âœ… All 27 MQTT broker configuration tests passing
   - âœ… Docker SDK integration test passing
   - âœ… ONNX model conversion test passing
   - âœ… Consensus camera telemetry processing passing

### In Progress Tasks ðŸ”„

1. **Remove Internal Module Mocking**
   - Fixed: test_consensus_enhanced_fixed.py - now uses real MQTT
   - Pending: test_camera_detector.py - extensive mqtt.Client mocking
   - Pending: test_detect.py - some internal detect module mocking
   - Note: test_new_features.py only mocks GPIO (external dependency) âœ…

2. **Apply MQTT Optimization Migration**
   - Topic isolation now supported by all services
   - Need to migrate remaining tests to use:
     - Session-scoped broker fixtures
     - Topic isolation via mqtt_topic_factory
     - Automatic client management

3. **Fix Individual Failing Tests**
   - test_consensus_enhanced_fixed.py - 2/6 tests passing
   - Need to fix cleanup between tests
   - Need to ensure proper topic prefix handling

### Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹

1. **Fix Individual Failing Tests**
   - Model converter E2E tests (timeout issues)
   - Integration tests requiring real hardware
   - Tests with internal mocking violations

2. **Verify All Tests Pass**
   - Run with scripts/run_tests_by_python_version.sh --all
   - Ensure Python version routing works correctly
   - Verify timeouts are properly configured

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Internal Mocking Violations**
   - Many tests mock paho.mqtt.Client instead of using real broker
   - Some tests mock internal modules (consensus, trigger, detect)
   - Must use real components for integration testing

2. **Test Isolation**
   - Tests were using shared MQTT topics causing interference
   - Now fixed with topic prefix support in all services
   - Tests need migration to use topic isolation

3. **Hardware Dependencies**
   - Tests should detect and skip if hardware not available
   - Must not mock hardware detection functions
   - Real hardware available: Coral TPU, TensorRT GPU, cameras

### Next Steps

1. Continue removing internal module mocking from:
   - test_camera_detector.py
   - test_detect.py

2. Migrate tests to use MQTT optimization patterns:
   - Session-scoped broker
   - Topic isolation
   - Automatic client management

3. Fix remaining test failures in test_consensus_enhanced_fixed.py

4. Run comprehensive test suite with all Python versions

### Configuration Requirements

All tests must:
- Use real MQTT broker (no mocking paho.mqtt.client)
- Use real wildfire-watch modules (no internal mocking)
- Pass camera credentials via environment variables only
- Work with run_tests_by_python_version.sh
- Handle timeouts properly (no hanging tests)
- Clean up resources properly

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Camera credentials for tests
export CAMERA_CREDENTIALS=""

# Run all tests with automatic Python version selection
./scripts/run_tests_by_python_version.sh --all

# Or run specific Python version tests
./scripts/run_tests_by_python_version.sh --python312
./scripts/run_tests_by_python_version.sh --python310
./scripts/run_tests_by_python_version.sh --python38
```

### Hardware Available

- 4x PCIe Coral TPUs (Edge TPU Accelerators)
- NVIDIA RTX A2000 12GB GPU with TensorRT
- Cameras on 192.168.4.x network
- Raspberry Pi 5 with Balena OS

### Test Infrastructure

- Session-scoped MQTT broker for all tests
- Topic isolation via unique prefixes
- Hardware detection with conditional skipping
- Docker network management via fixtures
- Proper cleanup and resource management
