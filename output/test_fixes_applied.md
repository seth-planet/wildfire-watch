# Test Fixes Applied

## Phase 1: MQTT Broker Fixes âœ… COMPLETE
- Fixed hardcoded 2-second wait in MQTTTestBroker._start_mosquitto()
- Added proper health check with wait_for_ready() method
- Enhanced session_mqtt_broker fixture with retry logic and diagnostics
- Result: MQTT tests now pass reliably

## Phase 2: Docker Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETE  
- Added session-scoped docker_client and docker_test_network fixtures
- Fixed test_integration_docker.py to use fixtures instead of creating own network
- Docker SDK integration test confirmed working
- Result: Docker tests can now run with proper network isolation

## Phase 3: Hardware Detection âœ… COMPLETE
- Added hardware detection functions:
  - has_coral_tpu() - detects 4 PCIe Coral TPUs via lspci and /dev/apex*
  - has_tensorrt() - detects NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU and TensorRT 10.12
  - has_camera_on_network() - detects cameras at 192.168.4.x subnet
  - has_hailo() - returns False (not installed)
- Fixed detection to work across Python versions (3.8/3.10/3.12)
- Result: Tests can now conditionally skip based on hardware availability

## Phase 4: Internal Mocking Issues ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- Found violations in test_consensus_enhanced.py - mocking paho.mqtt.Client
- Need to refactor tests to use real MQTT broker fixtures
- Other files may have similar issues

## Test Results After Fixes
Individual tests that now pass:
- test_lwt_is_set âœ…
- test_onnx_conversion âœ…  
- test_camera_telemetry_processing âœ…
- test_docker_sdk_integration âœ…

## Next Steps
1. Remove internal mocking from test_consensus_enhanced.py
2. Apply MQTT optimization migration patterns to old tests
3. Fix remaining individual test failures
4. Run full test suite with run_tests_by_python_version.sh
