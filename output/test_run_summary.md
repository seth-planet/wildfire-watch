# Comprehensive Test Run Summary

## Overall Results
- **Python 3.12**: ❌ FAILED (50 failed, 352 passed, 68 skipped, 108 errors)
- **Python 3.10**: ❌ FAILED (0 tests collected)
- **Python 3.8**: ❌ FAILED (0 tests collected)

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Missing Functions/Imports
- `has_hailo` function missing from `tests/conftest.py`
- ImportError in `test_e2e_hardware_docker.py`

### 2. Credential Parsing Errors
- Multiple tests failing due to empty credential strings after removal of hardcoded credentials
- `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)` in credential parsing
- Affected files:
  - `test_rtsp_validation_hardware.py`
  - Various integration tests

### 3. Missing Fixtures
- `mqtt_client` fixture not found in several tests
- `test_mqtt_tls_broker` fixture missing
- Suggests incomplete fixture migration or missing imports

### 4. TestMQTTBroker Issues
- `AttributeError: 'TestMQTTBroker' object has no attribute '_subscribers'`
- Affecting multiple test setups
- Issue in `enhanced_mqtt_broker.py`

### 5. Health Publishing Errors
- Multiple "Failed to publish health: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'publish'" errors
- Suggests MQTT client not properly initialized in some tests

## Test Collection Issues

### Python 3.10 and 3.8
- No tests collected for these Python versions
- Likely due to test markers filtering out all tests
- Need to verify test markers for `yolo_nas` (Python 3.10) and `coral_tpu` (Python 3.8)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Missing Functions**:
   - Add `has_hailo` function to `conftest.py`
   - Update imports in affected test files

2. **Handle Empty Credentials**:
   - Update credential parsing to handle empty strings gracefully
   - Add proper validation and skip tests when credentials not provided

3. **Fix Fixture Issues**:
   - Ensure all required fixtures are properly defined
   - Check fixture scope and availability

4. **Fix TestMQTTBroker**:
   - Initialize `_subscribers` attribute in TestMQTTBroker class
   - Review broker initialization code

5. **Test Markers**:
   - Review and fix test markers for Python 3.10 and 3.8
   - Ensure tests are properly marked for version-specific execution

## Next Steps

1. Fix the critical errors preventing test collection
2. Re-run tests with fixes applied
3. Address failing tests systematically
4. Ensure all Python version-specific tests are properly marked and collected
