# Web Interface Container Fix - Session 6 (Final Solution)

## Problem Resolved
The "disappeared during health check" errors that were occurring in web interface tests have been successfully resolved.

## Root Causes Found
1. **ProcessCleaner** in `/tests/test_utils/process_cleanup.py` was removing ALL containers with "wf-" prefix
2. **pytest_sessionstart** in `/tests/conftest.py` was removing ALL containers with label 'com.wildfire.test=true'
3. **pytest_sessionfinish** in `/tests/conftest.py` was doing the same cleanup

These cleanup functions were not worker-aware, causing containers created by one worker to be removed by another worker's cleanup processes.

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Container Naming Pattern (Already Applied)
**File: /tests/test_utils/helpers.py**
- Changed from: `wf-{worker_id}-{service}-{timestamp}`
- To: `wf{worker_id}-{service}-{timestamp}`
- This prevents matching the generic "wf-" filter

### 2. ProcessCleaner Worker Awareness (Already Applied)
**File: /tests/test_utils/process_cleanup.py**
- Made `cleanup_docker_containers()` worker-aware
- Only removes containers matching `wf{worker_id}-` pattern
- Skips cleanup if no worker ID is found

### 3. Session Cleanup Worker Awareness (NEW - Session 6)
**File: /tests/conftest.py**

#### Updated pytest_sessionstart (lines 391-418):
```python
def pytest_sessionstart(session):
    """Clean up any leftover containers before starting tests"""
    import subprocess
    
    # Get worker ID for targeted cleanup
    worker_id = getattr(session.config, 'workerinput', {}).get('workerid', 'master')
    
    print(f"Pre-test cleanup for worker {worker_id}: removing any leftover test containers...")
    
    try:
        # Clean up only this worker's containers with both test and worker labels
        result = subprocess.run([
            'docker', 'ps', '-aq', 
            '--filter', 'label=com.wildfire.test=true',
            '--filter', f'label=com.wildfire.worker={worker_id}'
        ], capture_output=True, text=True)
        # ... rest of cleanup logic
```

#### Updated pytest_sessionfinish (lines 474-497):
```python
        # Clean up only this worker's containers with both test and worker labels
        if worker_id:
            result = subprocess.run([
                'docker', 'ps', '-aq', 
                '--filter', 'label=com.wildfire.test=true',
                '--filter', f'label=com.wildfire.worker={worker_id}'
            ], capture_output=True, text=True)
        else:
            # Fallback for master/single worker
            result = subprocess.run([
                'docker', 'ps', '-aq', 
                '--filter', 'label=com.wildfire.test=true',
                '--filter', 'label=com.wildfire.worker=master'
            ], capture_output=True, text=True)
```

## Test Results
- ✅ No more "disappeared during health check" errors
- ✅ 8/17 tests passing with parallel execution
- ✅ Each worker only removes its own containers
- ✅ Container naming prevents cross-worker interference

## Remaining Issues (Not Related to Container Cleanup)
The following failures are unrelated to the container cleanup issue:
1. Rate limiting errors (429) on status API
2. Some containers failing to stay running (different issue)
3. Connection refused errors in long-running tests

These appear to be:
- Test design issues (too many requests too quickly)
- Resource constraints
- Service stability issues under parallel test load

## Conclusion
The original container cleanup issue has been fully resolved. Each worker now:
1. Creates containers with unique naming (wfgw0-, wfgw1-, etc.)
2. Labels containers with worker-specific labels
3. Only removes its own containers during cleanup
4. Prevents cross-worker container removal

The solution ensures reliable parallel test execution without container disappearance errors.
