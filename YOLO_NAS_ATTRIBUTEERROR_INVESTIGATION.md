# YOLO-NAS AttributeError Investigation Summary

## Date: July 20, 2025

## Problem
Test `test_yolo_nas_qat_hailo_e2e.py` continues to fail with:
```
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'shape'
```

## Investigation Results

### 1. ✅ ONNX Fix Verified
- The fix in `inference_runner.py` is in place and working
- Added `_find_first_numpy_array` method that handles nested dicts
- Tested directly - no error when parsing nested dict structures

### 2. ✅ Web Interface Tests
- Both tests are actually PASSING
- ERROR status in pytest summary was misleading
- 24 tests total pass successfully

### 3. 🔍 YOLO-NAS Test Investigation

#### Findings:
1. **Fix is Active**: The recursive numpy array finder is working
2. **Test Imports Correctly**: All modules import with the fix in place
3. **Error Still Occurs**: Despite the fix, the AttributeError persists

#### Possible Causes:
1. **Different Code Path**: The error might be happening in a different location
2. **Super-gradients Internal**: The error could be inside the super-gradients library
3. **ONNX Export Process**: The error might occur during model export, not inference
4. **Cached Bytecode**: Python might be using cached .pyc files (already cleared)

## Debug Enhancements Added

### 1. Enhanced Logging
```python
# Added debug logging in _parse_onnx_outputs
self.logger.debug(f"ONNX outputs type: {type(outputs)}")
if isinstance(outputs, dict):
    self.logger.debug(f"ONNX outputs keys: {list(outputs.keys())}")
```

### 2. Specific AttributeError Handling
```python
except AttributeError as e:
    # Special handling for the dict shape error
    self.logger.error(f"AttributeError processing {img_path}: {e}")
    self.logger.error(f"ONNX outputs type: {type(outputs)}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Test with Debug Logging
```bash
python3.10 -m pytest tests/test_yolo_nas_qat_hailo_e2e.py -xvs --log-cli-level=DEBUG 2>&1 | tee yolo_nas_debug.log
```

### 2. Alternative Approaches
- Check if super-gradients has its own ONNX inference code
- Verify the ONNX model structure after export
- Test with a minimal YOLO-NAS ONNX export

### 3. Potential Workarounds
- Use try/except around the specific failing operation
- Check super-gradients version compatibility
- Use alternative ONNX export method if available

## Key Insight
The error persists despite our fix being in place, suggesting:
1. The error occurs in a different location than expected
2. The super-gradients library might have its own ONNX handling
3. The error might be in the export process, not inference

## Recommendation
Run the test with enhanced debug logging to capture the exact location and context of the AttributeError. The added logging will show:
- The type and structure of ONNX outputs
- Whether our parsing method is even being called
- The full stack trace with more context
