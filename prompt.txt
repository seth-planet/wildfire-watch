Thank you for the excellent analysis! Let me provide additional context about the project and then search for the OpenCV RTSP timeout reliability information you requested.

## Additional Project Context:

The Wildfire Watch system is an automated fire detection and suppression platform designed for edge deployment. Here's the full context:

**System Architecture:**
- Multi-service Docker-based architecture communicating via MQTT
- Camera Detector discovers IP cameras and configures them
- Frigate NVR performs AI-based fire/smoke detection  
- Fire Consensus validates detections from multiple cameras
- GPIO Trigger controls water pump hardware
- All services use TLS-encrypted MQTT for production

**Key Requirements:**
- Must run on resource-constrained edge devices (Raspberry Pi 5)
- Handles network instability and camera IP changes gracefully
- Prevents false positives through multi-camera consensus
- Safety-critical system requiring robust error handling

**Camera Detector Specific Context (from README):**
- Uses Smart Discovery Mode to reduce resource usage (90%+ reduction after stabilization)
- Tracks cameras by MAC address to handle DHCP IP changes
- Supports ONVIF, mDNS, and RTSP port scanning discovery methods
- Automatically generates and updates Frigate NVR configuration
- Validates credentials and RTSP streams before configuration

Now, let me search for the OpenCV RTSP timeout reliability information you requested:

Please search for: "opencv python rtsp CAP_PROP_OPEN_TIMEOUT_MSEC reliability"

I'm particularly interested in:
1. Whether the OpenCV timeout properties work reliably across different backends
2. Community-vetted patterns for handling hanging RTSP connections
3. Best practices for robust RTSP stream validation in production environments
