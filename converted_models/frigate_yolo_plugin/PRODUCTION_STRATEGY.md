# Production Strategy for YOLO Fire Detection with Frigate

## Current Approach Analysis

### What We've Built
1. **Custom YOLO EdgeTPU Detector Plugin** - Properly handles YOLO tensor format [1, 36, 8400]
2. **Runtime Patch System** - Injects plugin into stable Frigate at container startup
3. **Working Docker Image** - Successfully built and verified

### Strengths
- Works with stable Frigate release
- No need to maintain Frigate fork
- Quick to implement and test
- Preserves all Frigate features

### Weaknesses
- Runtime patching is fragile
- May break with Frigate updates
- Not ideal for production deployment
- Harder to debug issues

## Recommended Production Approaches

### Option 1: Dedicated YOLO Detection Service (RECOMMENDED)
Instead of patching Frigate, create a separate microservice:

```yaml
services:
  frigate:
    image: ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:stable
    # Standard Frigate config
    
  yolo-detector:
    image: wildfire-yolo-detector:latest
    # Connects to cameras directly
    # Publishes detections to MQTT
    # Frigate consumes MQTT events
```

**Advantages:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Can update YOLO models independently
- No Frigate modifications needed
- Easier to maintain and debug

### Option 2: Use Alternative NVR with YOLO Support
Consider NVR systems that natively support YOLO:
- **DeepStack** - Has YOLO support built-in
- **CodeProject.AI** - Modular AI with YOLO plugins
- **Custom Solution** - Build minimal NVR focused on fire detection

### Option 3: Contribute to Frigate (Long-term)
Submit PR to Frigate project:
1. Clean up yolo_edgetpu plugin
2. Add comprehensive tests
3. Document YOLO tensor format handling
4. Submit as official plugin

## For Testing/Development

The current patch approach is acceptable for:
- E2E testing
- Development environments
- Proof of concept

But should NOT be used in production without:
- Proper CI/CD pipeline
- Version pinning
- Extensive testing
- Fallback mechanisms

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **For Immediate Testing**: Continue with patched Frigate
2. **For Production**: Implement dedicated YOLO service
3. **For Community**: Contribute plugin to Frigate project

## Implementation Priority

1. Get E2E tests passing with current approach
2. Design dedicated YOLO detection service
3. Implement production-ready solution
4. Migrate from patched Frigate to proper solution
