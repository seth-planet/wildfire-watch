# Test Fix Summary - Current Status

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Docker Container Management
- **Issue**: Container lifecycle problems, import errors
- **Fix**: Replaced Docker containers with local service instances for E2E tests
- **Result**: Services now start properly without "No module named" errors

### 2. Security NVR Integration Tests  
- **Issue**: Dictionary vs object attribute access errors
- **Fix**: Changed `config.attribute` to `config["attribute"]` throughout
- **Result**: Security NVR tests now pass configuration checks

### 3. E2E Integration Tests
- **Issue**: Service startup failures, environment variable mismatches
- **Fix**: 
  - Run services locally instead of in containers
  - Fixed MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX vs TOPIC_PREFIX mismatch
- **Result**: Services start and connect to MQTT properly

### 4. Test Infrastructure Updates
- **Fixtures**: Updated to work with refactored base classes
- **Topic Namespacing**: Fixed to ensure proper test isolation
- **Legacy Adapters**: Already in place in conftest.py

## Current Test Status

Based on ongoing test run (67% complete):

### Known Failures
1. **GPIO RPM Reduction Test**: Node termination issue
2. **E2E Pump Safety Timeout**: Fire consensus not triggering pump
3. **Docker SDK Integration**: Container management issues
4. **Security NVR Web Interface**: Frigate API access issues

### Test Categories
- **PASSED**: Most unit tests, hardware integration, model converter tests
- **FAILED**: Some integration tests, E2E tests with complex service coordination
- **SKIPPED**: Hardware-specific tests (Intel GPU, TLS configuration)

## Remaining Issues

1. **Fire Consensus Logic**: Not triggering pump despite receiving detections
   - Likely issue with detection growth algorithm or consensus threshold
   
2. **Docker Container Tests**: Some tests still trying to use containers
   - Need to update or mark as integration-only
   
3. **Test Timeouts**: Some tests taking very long or hanging
   - May need timeout adjustments or test simplification

## Next Steps

1. Fix fire consensus detection logic for E2E tests
2. Update remaining Docker-based tests
3. Address node termination issues in parallel tests
4. Complete full test suite run for final assessment

## Test Environment

- Python 3.12 primary, with 3.10 for YOLO-NAS and 3.8 for Coral TPU
- Using pytest with parallel execution (pytest-xdist)
- 30-minute timeout per test configured
- Camera credentials provided via environment
