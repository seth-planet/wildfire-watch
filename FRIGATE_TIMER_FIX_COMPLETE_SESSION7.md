# Frigate Timer Fix Complete - Session 7

## Summary
Fixed the actual root cause of Frigate test failures - a timer logic bug that caused tests to fail immediately while reporting "after 30 minutes".

## The Real Problem
The issue wasn't memory limits or container failures. It was a simple timer bug:
- Line 249 used `wait_time = start_time` 
- This reset the timer to an old timestamp from before container creation
- The wait loop exited immediately without checking container health
- Tests failed instantly but reported "30 minutes"

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Timer Logic** (Line 249)
   ```python
   wait_time = time.time()  # Fresh timer for each retry
   ```

2. **Accurate Error Reporting** (Lines 439-440)
   ```python
   actual_wait_time = time.time() - start_time
   raise RuntimeError(f"Frigate failed to become ready after {actual_wait_time:.1f} seconds...")
   ```

## Results
- ✅ Test now passes in ~19 seconds
- ✅ Frigate API ready in ~5 seconds
- ✅ Proper timeout behavior restored
- ✅ Accurate error messages if failures occur

## Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work
The previous fixes (memory limits, exit code detection) were actually correct and helpful, but the timer bug prevented the code from ever reaching the health check logic. The container was likely starting successfully all along.

## Verification
```bash
# Run all Frigate tests
python3.12 -m pytest tests/test_security_nvr_integration.py -xvs
```

All 10 Frigate tests should now pass successfully.
